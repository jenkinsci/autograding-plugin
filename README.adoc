image::graduation-cap.svg[Scores, width="100"]

Jenkins plugin that autogrades projects based on a configurable set of metrics. Currently, you can select from the 
following metrics:

- Test statistics (e.g., number of failed tests) from the https://github.com/jenkinsci/junit-plugin[JUnit Plugin]
- Code coverage (e.g., line coverage percentage) from the https://github.com/jenkinsci/code-coverage-api-plugin[Code Coverage API Plugin]
- PIT mutation coverage (e.g., missed mutations' percentage)  from the https://github.com/jenkinsci/pitmutation-plugin[PIT Mutation reporting plugin]
- Static analysis (e.g., number of warnings) from the https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin[Warnings Plugin - Next Generation]

For each metric you can define the impact on the overall score and the individual scoring criteria. After each build
the autograding plugin shows a summary in several progress charts and details in a table for each metric.

== Required workflow

In order to autograde a project, you first need to build your project using your favorite build tool. Make sure
your build invokes all tools that will produce the artifacts required for the autograding later on. Then 
run all post build steps that record the desired results using the plugins from the list above. Autograding is based
on the persisted Jenkins model of these plugins (i.e., Jenkins build actions), so make sure the results of these plugins
show correctly up in the Jenkins build view. The autograding has to be started as the last step: you can configure
the impact of the individual results using a simple JSON string. Currently, no UI configuration of the configuration is
available. The autograding step reads all requested build results and calculates a score based on the defined
properties in the JSON configuration.

== Job Configuration

Please have a look at the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/autograding-plugin/blob/master/etc/Jenkinsfile.autograding[example pipeline] that shows how to use this plugin in practice.
It consists of the following stages:   

. Checkout from SCM
. Build and test the project and run the static analysis with Maven
. Run the test cases and compute the line and branch coverage
. Run PIT to compute the mutation coverage
. Record all Maven warnings
. Autograde the results from steps 2-5

The example pipeline uses the following configuration that shows all possible parameters:

[source,json]
----
{
  "analysis": {
    "maxScore": 100,
    "errorImpact": -10,
    "highImpact": -5,
    "normalImpact": -2,
    "lowImpact": -1
  },
  "tests": {
    "maxScore": 100,
    "passedImpact": 1,
    "failureImpact": -5,
    "skippedImpact": -1
  },
  "coverage": {
    "maxScore": 100,
    "coveredImpact": 1,
    "missedImpact": -1
  },
  "pit": {
    "maxScore": 100,
    "detectedImpact": 1,
    "undetectedImpact": -1,
    "ratioImpact": 0
  }
}

----

If you want to skip one of the tools just remove the corresponding JSON node from the configuration.
Additionally, you need to select the individual configuration options based on your current assignment. Sometimes
it makes sense to start with a given number of points and subtract points for each violation (e.g., minus points for
each SpotBugs warning). For other metrics it makes more sense to add points for each achieved percentage (e.g., for
line coverage).
